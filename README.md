# Node.js IBM Cloud Foundry Demo

## Description

This project is a demonstration for Node.js Microservices and Container-to-Container networking on IBM Cloud Foundry. It involves two distrinct microservices in combination with a Cloudant NoSQL database and the Watson Visual Recognition API which provide a simple 'Guestbook' functionality to the user. In order to demonstrate the concept of Container-to-Container networking, the second microservice which connects to the Watson API is not required for the basic functionality of the application (add a guest, show all guests) and can be added sperately afterwards. This helps to show that both microservices/CF applications communicate with each other and that the second service only needs an internal route due to the configurated networking policy.

## Architecture

![architecture](.docs/architecture.png)

1. The frontend/interface for the user is served by the 'main-service' (left Node.js application)
2. Backend API calls to create a new guestbook entry and to retrieve entries and images
3. Save/Retrieve entries in/from the connected Cloudant database
4. API Request from 'main-service' to 'watson-service' to analyse the previously saved image
5. Use Waston Visual Recognition API to analyse the image using the provided image URL and create tags from this data
6. Retrieve the image stream from the Cloudant Blob store by using the previously (in step 3) created URL

## Contents

This repository includes both microservices/Node.js applications, the 'main-service' and the 'watson-service' which are saved in the same called sub-directories. Hereby, the 'main-service' is responsible for the basic functionality of the guestbook (HTML, create, list, database connection) while the 'watson-service' is optional and handles the connection with the Watson Visual Recognition API and their results. Both applications are full Node.js REST APIs and their root folders include a README.md file with more information about their functionality.

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Install latest version of IBM Cloud CLI: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started
- If not present, create Account on IBM Cloud: https://cloud.ibm.com/registration
- Login into your Cloud Foundry organization and space: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started#step3-configure-idt-env
- Latest version of GitHub: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Latest version of Node.js for running the server locally: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- code editior/IDE of your choice (VS CODE, Atom, Sublime...)

### Local setup

1. open a terminal at the location of your choice
2. clone Github Project using `git clone https://github.com/m-lukas/cf-nodejs-c2c-demo.git`
3. use command `cd cf-nodejs-c2c-demo` to access the project folder
4. open the project in the code editior/IDE of your choice

### Main-App

1. First of all, go to the "Compute" section in the IBM Cloud catalog by clicking on the navigation item "Catalog" on the IBM Cloud Dashboard and subsequently on the menu item "Compute" or by opening the following link: https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?search=label:lite&category=compute
2. In the list, search for the "SDK for Node.js" product card and click on it in order to create a new Cloud Foundry (CF) App based on the Node.js buildpack.
3. Fill out the form for the app creation:

  - *App name* - To keep it simple, we will use the name "guestbook-main" for this application. However you are free to use any other name but consider to change the name in all subsequent steps.
  - *Hostpath* - Leave it on the default value.
  - *Domain* -  Leave it on the default value.
  - *Region/Location*, *Organization* and *Space* - In the Lite version, use the region London for deployment. If organization and space fields don't have any values, you have to create a new Cloud Foundry (CF) organization and space before: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-orgsspacesusers
  - *Tags* - Add the tag "guestbook" to find your resources more easily.
  - *Pricing Plans* - Select your prefered pricing plan and memory. The Lite plan and 128MB of memory are sufficient.

4. Following, click on the button "Create" to submit the form and create the app.

- You have been redirected to an application overview and the app was created. Please wait until the app is started/awake. The status can be found in the header, near to the application name.
- Additionally, by clicking on the "Routes" button and subsequently, on the public URL in the list, you can check the status of the app directly. Afterwards, go back to the IBM Cloud website.

5. Go again to the "Catalog" by clicking on the same named navigation item but this time go to the "Databases" section or open the following link: https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?search=label:lite&category=databases
6. Search for the product card "Cloudant" and click on it, to create a new Cloudant NoSQL database.
7. Fill out the form for the database creation:

- *Service name* - To keep it simple, we will use the name "guestbook-database" for this service but you can use any other name for it as well.
- *Region/Location* - To reduce latency, use the same region/location as for the CF application.
- *Tags* - Add the tag "guestbook" to find your resources more easily.
- *Authentication Methods* - Select the authentification method: "Use both legacy credentials and IAM" to enable HTTP authentification which is needed to send the requests to the database.
- *Pricing Plans* - Select your prefered pricing plan and memory. The Lite plan is sufficient for our needs.

8. Click on the button "Create" to submit the form and create the database.

- You're redirected to the service overview.

9. In the side bar, click on the item "Connections".
10. Subsequently on the connections page, click the button "Create connection" to create a new connection configuration between the application and the service.
11. After selecting the region/location of the previously created application in the filter of the table, you will see the application "guestbook-main" as entry in the table.
12. Hover over the "guestbook-main" row to find the "Create" button and click on it.
13. In the form for creating the connection, you can stay with the default values. The "Access Role" should be "Manager". Following, click on "Connect & restage app".
14. You have to confirm the restaging of the "guestbook-main" application in another popup.
15. In the table, under "Connected Applications", you will find "guestbook-main" as entry. Click on the "guestbook-main" row to go to the application dashboard.

#### Local Testing (optional)

Local Testing is only necessary if you consider to modify the application code. In this case, you can very quickly restart the application and debug it more easily. In opposite to the second application of our example, the main-app ("guestbook-main") does not require the second application to work. If the second application ("guestbook-watson") is not available, it won't analyse the image to retrieve the tags but the rest of the guestbook does not depend on it. Please notice that the terminal will display a HTTP error (status 404) in this case which can be ignored.

1. On the application dashboard of the "guestbook-main" CF app, click on "Connections" in the side bar.
2. In the table, you will see the connection to the database "guestbook-database" as entry. In its row, click on the 3 horizontal dots to open the menu.
3. In the menu, click on "View credentials" to open a popup with the credentials for this connection.
4. Copy the displayed code block either by clicking on the small copy icon or by selecting the code and copying it by using CTLR/CMD + C.
5. Open your code-editor now and go into the subdirectory "main-app".
6. In it, you will find a file called `vcap-local.json.example`. Rename this file to `vcap-local.json` and paste the code behind `"services:"`.

- vcap-local.json is the local configuration for the connection to the database. It is automatically parsed on the start of the server and contains all connection information and credentials.
- After pasting, the file should look similar like this example:

```json
{
  "services": {
    "cloudantNoSQLDB": [
    {
      ...
    }
  ]
}
}
```

- Afterwards, the application is ready to be tested. ðŸŽ‰

7. In your terminal, navigate into the folder "main-app" by using the command: `cd <Path to folder>`
8. Use the command: `npm install` to install all dependencies of the application locally. If Node.js is not installed, install the latest version on your machine (see Prerequisites).
9. Following, start the server using: `npm run dev`. This opens the server using the package nodemon which reloads the server on every file change.

- The expected output of this command looks something like this:

```shell
    ...
    Loaded local VCAP { services: { cloudantNoSQLDB: [ [Object] ] } }
    Successfully initialized cloudant client!
    [ENV] Server Port: 
    [ENV] Image Base Path: 
    [ENV] Watson Microservice: 
    Listening on port: 5000
```

- The app should be available on your local browser using the URL: http://localhost:5000/

#### Cloud Foundry Deployment (required)

1. Open your code-editor now and go into the subdirectory "main-app".
2. In the file `manifest.yml`, check the name field and if its not set already, set the value to your application name (for example: "guestbook-main").
3. In your terminal, navigate into the folder "main-app" by using the command: `cd <Path to folder>`
4. Push the application to IBM Cloud using the CLI (installation see Prerequisites):

- Use the command `ibmcloud login -sso` to log into your IBM Cloud account using Single-Sign-On.

> IF the region in the output table does NOT accord your previously selected region/location for the "guestbook-main" application, use the command `ibmcloud login -sso -r <region>` to change it (for example: `ibmcloud login -sso -r eu-gb`) for London.

- Afterwards, target your CF organization and space using `ibmcloud target --cf`. This will complete your local configuration for pushing to Cloud Foundry.
- With the command `ibmcloud cf push` you can push (upload and deploy) your application to IBM Cloud Foundry now.
- After a successful push, you will see an output similar to this:

```shell
Waiting for app to start...

```

- You can copy the `route` value from the output now and open it in the browser to see the deployed Guestbook.

### Watson-App

1. In your browser, go again to the IBM Cloud dashboard (https://cloud.ibm.com/).
2. Similar to the procedure for the first application, go to the "Compute" section in the IBM Cloud catalog by clicking on the navigation item "Catalog" and subsequently on the menu item "Compute" or by opening the following link: https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?search=label:lite&category=compute
3. In the list, search for the "SDK for Node.js" product card and click on it in order to create a new Cloud Foundry (CF) App based on the Node.js buildpack.
4. Fill out the form for the app creation:

  - *App name* - To keep it simple, we will use the name "guestbook-watson" for this application. However you are free to use any other name but consider to change the name in all subsequent steps.
  - *Hostpath* - Leave it on the default value.
  - *Domain* -  Leave it on the default value.
  - *Region/Location*, *Organization* and *Space* - In the Lite version, use the region London for deployment. If organization and space fields don't have any values, you have to create a new Cloud Foundry (CF) organization and space before: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-orgsspacesusers
  - *Tags* - Add the tag "guestbook" to find your resources more easily.
  - *Pricing Plans* - Select your prefered pricing plan and memory. The Lite plan and 128MB of memory are sufficient.

5. Following, click on the button "Create" to submit the form and create the app.

- You have been redirected to an application overview and the app was created. Please wait until the app is started/awake. The status can be found in the header, near to the application name.
- Additionally, by clicking on the "Routes" button and subsequently, on the public URL in the list, you can check the status of the app directly. Afterwards, go back to the IBM Cloud website.

6. Go again to the "Catalog" by clicking on the same named navigation item but this time go to the "AI" section or open the following link: https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?search=label:lite&category=ai
7. Search for the product card "Visual Regocnition" and click on it, to create new API credentials for the IBM Watson API.
8. Fill out the form for the service creation:

- *Service name* - To keep it simple, we will use the name "guestbook-visual" for this service but you can use any other name for it as well.
- *Tags* - Add the tag "guestbook" to find your resources more easily.
- *Pricing Plans* - Select your prefered pricing plan and memory. The Lite plan is sufficient for our needs.

8. Click on the button "Create" to submit the form and create the database.

- You're redirected to the service overview.

9. In the side bar, click on the item "Connections".
10. Subsequently on the connections page, click the button "Create connection" to create a new connection configuration between the application and the service.
11. After selecting the region/location of the previously created application in the filter of the table, you will see the application "guestbook-watson" as entry in the table.
12. Hover over the "guestbook-watson" row to find the "Create" button and click on it.
13. In the form for creating the connection, you can stay with the default values. The "Access Role" should be "Manager". Following, click on "Connect & restage app".
14. You have to confirm the restaging of the "guestbook-watson" application in another popup.
15. In the table, under "Connected Applications", you will find "guestbook-watson" as entry. Click on the "guestbook-watson" row to go to the application dashboard.

#### Local Testing (Main-App + Watson-App) (optional)

Local Testing is only necessary if you consider to modify the application code. Testing the second application is more complicated than testing the first one. The Watson API requires a public URL of the image which it is going to analyse. While Cloudant lets you save files in a integrated Blob-store as well, it does require authentification for accessing the uploaded file via a public URL. That's why, the main-app provides a public URL and pipes the file-stream from Cloudant. However, this requires a deployed version of the main-app and some configuration which is discribed in this section.

1. Make sure that you deployed the "Main-App" to Cloud Foundry (see Main-App > Cloud Foundry Deployment)
2. Go to the IBM Cloud Dashboard (https://cloud.ibm.com/)

#### Local Deployment

(step is only possible with local deployment of main-service)

- in the sidebar- click on the item "Connections"
- in the table you will the the "guestbook-visual" service, as binded connection
- subsequently, click on the 3 horizontal dots (menu) in the table row and click on "View credentials" and copy the credentials JSON
- in your code-editor go into the directory "watson-service" and open the file "vcap-local.json.example"
- behind "services": paste the credentials JSON
- example:
```
{
  "services": {
    "{"watson_vision_combined": [
    {
      ...
    }
  ]
}
}
```
- switch to a new terminal tab, go into the folder, run `npm install` and following: `npm run dev`
- this will start your local application
- => in the web app (localhost) - the appluication should be run completely (tags)

(WATSON SERVICE NEEDS CLOUDANT URL!)
